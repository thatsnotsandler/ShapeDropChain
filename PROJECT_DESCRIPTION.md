# ShapeDropChain

ShapeDropChain: Privacy-preserving blockchain Tetris game with FHEVM encrypted scores and public leaderboards.

ShapeDropChain is a blockchain-based Tetris game that combines classic gameplay with privacy-preserving technology. Built on FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine), it enables players to submit scores on-chain while maintaining privacy through encrypted records.

The project features a dual-record system: public leaderboards for competitive rankings and encrypted mirrors for personal best scores. Players connect MetaMask wallets, play across multiple difficulty levels, view global leaderboards, and access encrypted game history. ShapeDropChain demonstrates how blockchain gaming can preserve user privacy while maintaining transparency and verifiability.
